# 🎞️ Video Frame Extractor 🖼️

This Python program 🐍 extracts individual frames from a video file 🎥 and saves them as separate image files 📷. It uses the OpenCV library 📚 to read the video file and extract frames, and allows you to specify the start and end time of the portion of the video you want to extract frames from, as well as the frame rate at which to extract the frames.

## Usage 🚀

To use the program, simply run video_frame_extractor.py and specify the path to the video file you want to extract frames from, as well as any other options you want to set (such as the start and end time, or the frame rate). The program will then extract the frames and save them as individual image files in the same directory as the video file. It also has GUI 😃!, if you are not familier with CLI stuffs. Just run video_frame_extractor.py to activate the GUI.

## Requirements 🛠️

The program requires the following libraries to be installed:

- OpenCV (cv2) 📚
- NumPy 🧮
