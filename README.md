# 🎞️ Video Frame Extractor 🖼️

This Python program 🐍 extracts individual frames from a video file 🎥 and saves them as separate image files 📷. It uses the OpenCV library 📚 to read the video file and extract frames, and allows you to specify the start and end time of the portion of the video you want to extract frames from, as well as the frame rate at which to extract the frames.

The program can be run in both CLI and GUI modes:

- In CLI mode, simply run video_frame_extractor.py and specify the path to the video file you want to extract frames from, as well as any other options you want to set. The program will then extract the frames and save them as individual image files in the same directory as the video file.

- In GUI mode, run gui_video_frame_extractor.py to launch the PyQT5-based GUI. This interface allows you to select the video file and set the start and end time, frame rate, and output directory through a graphical interface.

## Requirements 🛠️

The program requires the following libraries to be installed:

- OpenCV (cv2) 📚
- NumPy 🧮
- PyQT5 (for GUI) 🖥️
